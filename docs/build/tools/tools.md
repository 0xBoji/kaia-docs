#### Kaikas <a id="kaikas"></a>

* Kaikas is a secure, developer-friendly wallet for the Kaia Network that is seamlessly integrated into the web as a browser extension. Kaikas empowers you to store and interact with KAIA/Kaia-based tokens, and to sign transactions from Kaia dApps (Decentralized Applications) on the web in realtime.

#### Kaia Wallet  <a id="kaia-wallet"></a>

* Kaia Wallet is a browser-based account management tool for the dApp (Decentralized Application) developers. You can create/load your accounts, review your account balance, and transfer KAIA. You can also register your own Kaia tokens to test basic behaviors.

#### Kaiascope <a id="klaytnscope"></a>

* Kaiascope is the block explorer for the Kaia Network. You can browse and inspect your transactions on the browser.

#### Covalent API <a id="Covalent"></a>

* Covalent aggregates information from across dozens of sources including nodes, chains, and data feeds. This Covalent RESTful API allows you to pull detailed, granular and historical blockchain transaction data from Kaia (and other blockchains) with no code. The Covalent API allows you to create entirely new applications or augment existing ones without configuring or maintaining blockchain infrastructure.

* Supported endpoints- All Class A endpoints are supported for the Kaia Mainnet and the Kaia testnet Kairos. You can query either network via the unified API by changing the chainId. For more information, see [Covalent Docs](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/klaytn#supported-endpoints). -->
